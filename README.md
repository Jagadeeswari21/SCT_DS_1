# Task 1: Visualizing Data Distribution

## What this is about
This is my work for Task 1 of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal was to explore some data and create a simple bar chart or histogram to see how data is spread out.

## What I did
- I used data from the World Bank about total population.
- Opened the data in **Jupyter Notebook**, which I was excited to learn for the first time.
- Explored the columns to understand what’s inside.
- Picked the data for the year 2022 and sorted the countries by population.
- Created a bar chart that shows the top 10 most populated countries.

## What I learned
- How to read data from a CSV file using *pandas*.
- How to use *matplotlib* and *seaborn* to make a bar chart.
- The basic workflow in Jupyter Notebook: writing code, running cells, and adding explanations.
- It felt great to actually see the chart appear after writing the code.

## Why this matters
Seeing the chart helped me understand the data better.  
Just looking at numbers in a table isn’t the same as seeing it visually.  
This was my first step into data visualization, and it made data feel more real and easier to explain.

## Files included
- **Task1.ipynb** : My Jupyter Notebook with the code and the chart.
- **README.md** : This file, where I explain what I did and what I learned.

## Final thoughts
I was really happy to finish this task because it was my first real experience using Jupyter Notebook.  
It made me realize how powerful and friendly Python can be for exploring data.
